Level Editor Qt
===============

This summer, I chose to write a paper dealing with video games programming. I chose this subject because I wanted to explore the Tools Programming, for a level-editor use.

You can read the paper here : http://emelineberenguier.com/download/BERENGUIER_Search_Paper.pdf

One of my experimental projects was a Level Editor on Qt with C++ language.

You can edit the level and save it.

And load it to update it.

You can load the level's save in an other software like Unity.
